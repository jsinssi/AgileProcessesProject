**Book Recommendation App**

** The Idea **
In the contemporary digital environment, the overwhelming volume of available books poses significant challenges for users seeking content that matches their personal interests. Traditional search and browsing methods often prove inefficient, resulting in decision fatigue and reduced user satisfaction. This project addresses this problem through the design and development of a Book Recommendation System that employs user ratings in conjunction with content metadata such as genre, star rating, and descriptive attributes to generate personalized suggestions. The proposed system will be implemented using an Agile methodology, enabling iterative development, continuous stakeholder feedback, and incremental delivery of functional components. The dataset underpinning the system consists of approximately 5,000–10,000 records, incorporating 8–12 structured features including title, genre, author or director, release year, average rating, and user-provided star scores. The primary stakeholders include end-users, who will benefit from improved content discovery; the development team, responsible for system implementation; and the product owner, ensuring alignment with project objectives. The anticipated outcome is a functional and scalable application that enhances the efficiency of information retrieval, supports personalized engagement with cultural media, and contributes to the broader field of recommender system research. 

** The End Goal **
The goal of this project is to create a Book Recommendation System that helps users easily find books that match their personal interests. By combining user ratings with key details like genre, author, and average rating, the system will deliver tailored suggestions that make the search for new reads faster and more enjoyable. Using an Agile approach, the project will evolve through continuous feedback and iterative development to ensure it meets user needs. Ultimately, the aim is to build a reliable, scalable tool that reduces decision fatigue, improves book discovery, and offers a more personalized reading experience.
